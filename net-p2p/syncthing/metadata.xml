        The following are the project goals:
          - Define a protocol for synchronization of a file repository between a number of collaborating nodes.
            The protocol should be well defined, unambiguous, easily understood, free to use, efficient, secure and language neutral. This is the Block Exchange Protocol.
          - Provide the reference implementation to demonstrate the usability of said protocol.
            This is the syncthing utility. It is the hope that alternative, compatible implementations of the protocol will come to exist.
          - The two are evolving together; the protocol is not to be considered stable until syncthing 1.0 is released, at which point it is locked down for incompatible changes.
