		Dropbox is software that syncs your files online and across your
		computers.
		Put your files into your Dropbox on one computer, and they'll be
		instantly available on any of your other computers that also have
		Dropbox installed (Windows, Mac, and Linux too!). Because copies of your
		files are stored on Dropbox's secure servers, you can also access them
		from any computer or mobile device using the Dropbox website.
